How to use:
Change what you want in settings.txt (a default is provided)
run generate.exe
run the generated AHK file
select place for the character to be typed
press the hotkey (default ctl+alt+])
click desired character or nagivate using arrow keys + enter

AHK required https://www.autohotkey.com/
If you have python you can just run the .py file if it works and just delete the .exe
	otherwise, you can delete the .py file
go to https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm for hotkey list


Tips:
characters can be repeated so feel free to repeat a "." or something to better split up lines or divide buttons into sections

I like to have the script open on startup, you can figure out how to do that if you want
